          Situated inland from Bentota’s coast, roughly 12 kilometres from Taru Villas’ properties, the Lunuganga Estate is one of the popular attractions in Bentota. Once the home of renowned local architect Geoffrey Bawa, the housing complex along with the gardens showcase ‘Tropical Modernism’ in its quintessence. The river, coupled with typical renaissance architecture and oriental designs, make the estate a charming affair.

Lunuganga Estate is an idyllic location for all types of travellers, whether couples, friends or family, to spend the day in, as the atmosphere is such that it induces a sense of calmness. Need assistance in planning your visit here? Our team at Taru Villas will be delighted to plan your visit to Lunuganga Estate.
