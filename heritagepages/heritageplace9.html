          This gorgeous island in the town of Bentota, which is about 65 kilometres from Columbo, is a place where you can witness the making of the favourite cinnamon spice. It is famous for its spice heritage and the engaging water sports offered by the island.
          You can experience the process of harvesting, peeling, oiling, and rolling of cinnamon on this island that is known to be run by a single family. It offers a change of scenery and a way to get familiar with this aromatic spice in its purest form. The island has cinnamon trees sprawling over acres of land, and the plantations date back to the 1900s. Breathtaking architecture and villas make the island a must visit location for tourists.
