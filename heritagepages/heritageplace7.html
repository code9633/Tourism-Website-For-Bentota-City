            The over 100-year-old  iron bridge spanning the Bentota River was closed to vehicular traffic a few years ago. Today the bridge is in a dilapidated condition and is currently used only by pedestrians.
            At nights the bridge which is in a sad state of neglect becomes a haven for drug dealers and alcohol peddlers.
            Due to lack of maintenance today the bridge is in bad state of corrosion, decay and sections of the bridge are about collapse.
            Villagers warn the state of bridge poses a danger to tourists who engage in boat rides on the Bentata River, especially those who pass underneath this bridge.
            The bridge has not been used since 2008 after it began showing signs of collapse. As a result a new bridge was built for vehicular and pedestrian travel.
            Local residents believe the bridge is of historic importance and request authorities to have the bridge renovated so that in the future it could be used by smaller vehicles and pedestrians.
