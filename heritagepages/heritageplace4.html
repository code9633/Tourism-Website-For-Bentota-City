              A dominating statue of the Buddha is the first thing you see as you approach the Kande Viharaya. Set on an 18th century hilltop temple, this 160 feet tall statue of the Buddha sitting cross-legged is believed to be one of the tallest in the world. Kande Viharaya is located in the town of Bentota; 
              approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes away from Mirissa and is ideal for a quick day trip. Bentota is most known as the watersports hub of Sri Lanka and those in the area can partake in a range of activities after a visit to the temple. However, as this is a religious site, remember to dress modestly, covering your shoulders and knees when you’re inside the premises. 
              The temple was originally discovered in 1734  and has since been a significant site for worshippers and is known to be one of the most sacred temples on the island. Within the sacred premises, you’ll find a Stupa. a 300-year-old Bodhi Tree that sits in the garden, a Relic Chamber; the oldest structure within the sacred site, the Upulvan Devalaya and other temples including Kataragama and Pattini Devalaya.
