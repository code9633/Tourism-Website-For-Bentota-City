            Close to the wilderness of the Sinharaja strict natural forest reserve there is a place by the name of Kalugala Arannanaya, a Buddhist monastery â€“ a perfect setting for peaceful meditation. For that reason, for the monks in this monastery, meditation has become a daily ritual in their search for a path to nirvana. People from far away places comes here to give their offerings to the monks . Kalugala Arannaya is indeed a safe haven for those looking for peace of mind. Founded in 1940 by a great philanthropist in the area, P. Samaradivakara Ralahamy , Kalugala now has become a land of hope in showing the path to end suffering for the monks and Buddhist devotees a like.

Reaching Kalugala is not that easy. The motor able road is available only up to a small village called Gurulu Bedda in Badureliya Agalawatte
